Basic Decorator Operations
==========================

Creating a datalite class
-------------------------

A datalite class is a special dataclass. It is created by using a decorator ``@datalite.datalite``,
members of this class are, from Python's perspective, just normal classes. However, they have
additional methods and attributes. ``@datalite`` decorator needs a database path to be provided.
This database is the database the table for the dataclass will be created.

.. code-block:: python

    from datalite import datalite
    @datalite(db_path='db.db')
    @dataclass
    class Student:
        student_id: int = 1
        student_name: str = "Kurt GÃ¶del"
        student_gpa: float = 3.9

Here, ``datalite`` will create a table called ``student`` in the database file ``db.db``, this
file will include all the fields of the dataclass as columns. Default value of these columns
are same as the default value of the dataclass.

Special Methods
---------------

Each object initialised from a dataclass decorated with the ``@dataclass`` decorator automatically
gains access to three special methods. It should be noted, due to the nature of the library, extensions
such as ``mypy`` and IDEs such as PyCharm will not be able to see these methods and may raise exceptions.

With this in mind, let us create a new object and run the methods over this objects.

.. code-block:: python

    new_student = Student(0, "Albert Einstein", 4.0)

Creating an Entry
##################

First special method is ``.create_entry()`` when called on an object of a class decorated with the
``@datalite`` decorator, this method creates an entry in the table of the bound database of the class,
in this case, table named ``student`` in the ``db.db``. Therefore, to create the entry of Albert Einstein
in the table:

.. code-block:: python

    new_student.create_entry()

This also modifies the object in an intresting way, it adds a new attribute ``obj_id``, this is a unique,
autoincremented value in the database. It can be accessed by ``new_student.obj_id``.

Updating an Entry
##################

Second special method is ``.update_entry()``. If an object's attribute is changed, to update its
record in the database, this method must be called.

.. code-block:: python

    new_student.student_gpa = 5.0  # He is Einstein, after all.
    new_student.update_entry()


Deleting an Entry
##################

To delete an entry from the record, the third and last special method, ``.remove_entry()`` should
be used.

.. code-block:: python

    new_student.remove_entry()

.. warning::

    It should be noted that, if the ``new_student.obj_id`` attribute is modified, ``.update_entry()``
    and ``.remove_entry()`` may have unexpected results.
